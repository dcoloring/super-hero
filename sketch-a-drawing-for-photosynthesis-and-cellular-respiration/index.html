1 photosynthesis creates glucose molecules instead of eating 2 this fuels cellular respiration in the plant cells 3 creates atp 4 fuels plant. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration photosynthesis creates glucose molecules (instead of eating) → this fuels cellular respiration in the plant cells → which creates atp → which fuels plant growth and reproduction → which provides carbohydrates to animals for their cellular respiration. Identify the parts of the plant involved in photosynthesis. Here’s the equation for cellular respiration:
