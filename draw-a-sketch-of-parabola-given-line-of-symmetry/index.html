Explore the relationship between the equation and the graph of a parabola using our interactive parabola. This tutorial focuses on how to identify the line of symmetry. Out of this we need ways to always find those essential components. To fill it up, substitute any value to #x# and write down the corresponding value of #y#.

<p>The line of symmetry is always a vertical line of the form x = n, where n is a real number. The axis of symmetry of a parabola is a vertical line that divides the parabola into two congruent halves. For example, a regular pentagon has 5 lines of symmetry. On this page, we will practice drawing the axis on a graph, learning the formula, stating the equation of the axis of symmetry when we know the parabola's equation Engineering drawing PARABOLA and its CONSTRUCTION by.</p>
