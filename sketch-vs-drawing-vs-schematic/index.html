Chemists use schematic drawings to describe how different elements interact with each other to create a product. Their targeted users or readers are different, where schematics are widely used among advanced schematics viewers while the circuit diagrams are friendly to beginners. While most of the drawings made during the schematic design phase are likely to be plans, these should be accompanied by elevations and sketches of suggested details.

<p>A schematic is defined as a picture that shows something in a simple way, using symbols. The first step is called programming which is when the client and architect discuss the requirements of the project (how many rooms, the function of the phases, etc.), testing the fit between the ownerâs needs, wants, and budget. Good programming and planning lay the groundwork for a successful design process, and ultimately a successful construction project. Pictorial diagrams, block diagrams, and wiring diagrams are the simplest diagrams and are best suited for the average homeowner or handyman tackling a weekend project.
