full metal etch a sketch My second etch a sketch drawing From flickr.com
Draw sketches first in the exploratory stages of a design to propose, refine, communicate and critique your ideas in a “tangible” format. I’ll admit, back then, it was one of my least favorite toys. Then tap gently so the dust/beads settle by the knobs. This drawing process took several hours to complete as i had to get used to using the etch a sketch and work out how to minimise the connecting lines which weren’t part of the lines of the drawing, to make it neater.
